# Randomize F1 Driver Application

# About
This application is a simple tool which helped me dive into working with Vue.js. Following a crash course on YouTube (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs), I personalized the introductory project (a random person generator) to my liking. 

# Data
I accessed data by fetching information using the GET method from a free Formula One API hosted by Ergast. More information on this data can be found at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11586746/SztEa7bL.
